# Sentiment-Analysis-Development-of-Indonesia-Telemedicine-Industry
I describe the acceptance, growth, and development of Telemedicine Industry in Indonesia by performing sentiment analysis on Google Play Review of several Indonesian telemedicine apps.
  
  
Based on data processing and dashboards, several insights were obtained regarding the telemedicine industry in Indonesia: 
- The application that dominates Indonesia's telemedicine services is Halodoc followed by Alodokter, KlikDokter, The Good Doctor, and Medcall.  
- The oldest telemedicine service in Indonesia is KlikDokter, while the youngest is The Good Doctor.  
- Indonesian people's interest in telemedicine services jumped dramatically during the pandemic, but also decreased drastically when the pandemic ended.  
- The peak of customer satisfaction will be in 2020 quartile 2 when the pandemic begins to enter Indonesia and tends to start to decline in 2021. 
- The average customer satisfaction has a downward trend according to all 4 parameters (playstore review scores, SentiWordNet scores, VADER scores, and Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier scores). 
- The problems experienced by telemedicine users are generally related to customer service, application performance, in-app payments, insurance, and the in-app drug purchase feature.  
  
Telemedicine should improve their application performance and customer service. They should also perform further user survey on why their desire and pain points on their services to innovate a approach on telemedicine service, fit to Indonesian market.
